Hanqing Xu received a B.Sci degree from Wuhan University of Life Science in 2019 and is currently pursuing a Master of Computer Science at the University of Sydney, scheduled to commence in August 2025.

From 2023 to 2024, he leaded the development of the TS-V5001, a fully automated AI analyzer for pets at Tansheng Diagnostics. This device leverages convolutional neural network (CNN)-based visual recognition, integrating microfluidic reagent cards and automated microscopy systems to achieve higher accuracy and intelligence compared to traditional five-category hematology analyzers.

Earlier in his career, he served as an Assistant Editor for the journal  [Sensors](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors) under MDPI, where he managed the [Fault Diagnosis & Sensors](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/sections/fault) section.

His research focuses on medical image recognition, computer vision, and deep learning.

Earlier in his college life, Hanqing conducted his undergraduate thesis research in Professor Wen Zhang's lab at the School of Computer Science, Wuhan University, [Professor Zhang](http://zhangwenlab.cn/indexen.html#student) is now affiliated with Huazhong Agricultural University. Hanqing’s work focused on applying CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) to predict RNA-disease associations, culminating in his thesis titled “Deep Learning Network Based Long-non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs)-Disease Association Prediction Model”.
